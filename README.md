## Philippa McCabe

This is my attempt at having a digital footprint!

I am currently 3 months into my applied mathematics PhD at [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/). 

My PhD is working with the [OActive project](https://www.oactive.eu/) to use statistical and machine learning tools to develop a diagnostic and predicitve model for osteoarthritis. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/phimc95/My-Project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
