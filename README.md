## This is my attempt at having a digital footprint!

I am currently 6 months into my applied mathematics PhD at [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/). 

My PhD is working with the [OActive project](https://www.oactive.eu/) to use statistical and machine learning tools to develop a diagnostic and predicitve model for osteoarthritis. 

I work with the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/department-of-applied-mathematics) and the [School of Sport and Exercise Science](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-science/school-of-sport-and-exercise-sciences).
