## Research Project
My thesis is studying the diagnosis and predictive modelling of osteoarthritis through statistical and machine learning methods. 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative bone disease that affects joints as a whole. OA is one of the most common diseases affecting people in old age with the prevalence in people 65 years and older range from 12% to 30%. The disease is also the most common form of arthritis to cause pain and mobility limitations. 
When diagnosising OA x-rays are taken. The scale to classify OA is the Kellgren-Lawrence scale grading form 0-4 depending on severity. A clinician usually analyses and classifies images for diagnosis. By using both humans and machines there is the potential for more reliable diagnoses in the future. 

## Research Interests
I am interested in machine learning approaches and how interpretability can be maximised, allowing for results that can be easily understand and used with confidence. My previous work has looked at multitask learning and how it can be used to aid in drug design and discovery by making better use of QSARs. I will be giving a talk at [IJCNN](https://www.ijcnn.org/) about this.

## Biography
I am currently 6 months into my applied mathematics PhD at [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/). 

My PhD is working with the [OActive project](https://www.oactive.eu/) to use statistical and machine learning tools to develop a diagnostic and predicitve model for osteoarthritis. 

I work with the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/department-of-applied-mathematics) and the [School of Sport and Exercise Science](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-science/school-of-sport-and-exercise-sciences).
