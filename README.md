## This is my attempt at having a digital footprint!

I am currently 6 months into my applied mathematics PhD at [Liverpool John Moores University](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/). 

My PhD is working with the [OActive project](https://www.oactive.eu/) to use statistical and machine learning tools to develop a diagnostic and predicitve model for osteoarthritis. 

I work with the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/department-of-applied-mathematics) and the [School of Sport and Exercise Science](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-science/school-of-sport-and-exercise-sciences).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/phimc95/My-Project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
